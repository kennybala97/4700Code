Question 3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B
----------
This seems to be plotting mode 00 since "nmodes" is set to one. For this
mode it's getting it for both the TE and TM case. In other words, when
the E-field is transverse to the direction of propagation, and when the
H-field is transverse instead. I'm guessing in "wgmodes.m" you configure
your setup using the boundary condition parameter "000A" and "000S". This
way you can set the boundary conditions to get TM or TE depending on what
you want.

C
----------
Run "basic_fullvector_part3c.m" to get the plots

D
----------
I implemented this using "contourmode_part3d.m", which you can replace
directly with "contourmode.m". Well, it worked for me, I hope it works
for anyone else who tries to run it too.

Surf seems more useful than contour. It shows the gradient much
more smoothly. At the same time, seeing the ridge waveguide boundaries
is not as easy, so that is somewhat of a downside.

Question 4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A
----------
The code is in "basic_fullvector_part4.m"

B
----------
After looking at the figures, you can tell the wave is "leaking out of
the ridge and into what I assume is the substrate. Basically as you decrease
the ridge half-width the structure becomes a much worse waveguide as most
of the energy is not in the ridge itself. It seems to be this is because of
either two things. First, the most likely explanation to me is that as the
ridge full-width approaches lambda/2, the structure alone cannot support
the fundamental mode. Thus, the wave begins leaking out. Otherwise though,
it might also be because the mesh is simply not fine enough to support a
good simulation at the lower ridge half-width lengths.

N_eff also goes down. I assume this is once again because there is less
"ridge" in the simulation, and more "air". Thus the reduction in lambda
from the ridge is lower, and N_eff goes down.

C
----------
After changing dx and dy in "basic_fullvector_part4c.m", i didnt really
notice any difference. I made both of them 8x bigger, and that did change Hx,
but for some reason it did not change Hy


Question 5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The basic condition for an optical fiber is that n_core > n_clad. Since
the core index is super low at the start, pretty much the whole wave leaks
out and refracts instead of reflecting at the interface between core and
cladding. As the index of the ridge increases, this goes away and you get
most of the wave's energy inside the waveguide once the index goes back up
to 3.44
